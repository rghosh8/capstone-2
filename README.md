#  True or False? Disaster Recognition from Tweets


## Abstract

This particular capstone focuses on using machine learning to pick up tweets related to disasters from a series of tweets. 

## Introduction

Twitter has become a prevalent communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitous smartphones enables people to announce an emergency in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. FEMA, disaster relief organizations, and news agencies).



### Data Source

The dataset used in the capstone is collected from this link: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data)

Demonstrate that you have looked at your data. What are your columns?

#### Columns

* `id (int64 type)`: a unique identifier for each tweet
* `text(str type)`: the test of the tweet
* `location(str type)`: the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
* `keyword(str type)`: a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
* `target (int64 type)`: present in `train.csv` only, this denote whether the tweet is about a real disaster (`1`) or not (`0`)
