# Thorax Disease Classification Based on the X-Ray Data


## Abstract

This particular capstone focuses on using machine learning techiques to analyze NIH X-Ray dataset and recognize thorax disease type based on the analysis. The orginial dataset involves 14 different data labels, including: (1, Atelectasis; 2, Cardiomegaly; 3, Effusion; 4, Infiltration; 5, Mass; 6, Nodule; 7, Pneumonia; 8,
Pneumothorax; 9, Consolidation; 10, Edema; 11, Emphysema; 12, Fibrosis; 13,
Pleural_Thickening; 14 Hernia)  

## Introduction

### Background

Although chest X-ray exam is one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examination,  clinical diagnosis of chest X-ray can be challenging, and
Even some promising
work have been reported in the past, and especially in recent deep learning work on
Tuberculosis (TB) classification. To achieve clinically relevant computer-aided detection and
diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites on all data settings of chest X-rays is still very
difficult, if not impossible when only several thousands of images are employed for study. This is
evident from [2] where the performance deep neural networks for thorax disease recognition is
severely limited by the availability of only 4143 frontal view images [3] (Openi is the previous
largest publicly available chest X-ray dataset to date).
