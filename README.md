# Thorax Disease Classification based on the X-Ray Data


## Abstract

This particular capstone focuses on using machine learning techiques to analyze NIH X-Ray dataset and recognize thorax disease type based on the analysis. The orginial dataset involves 14 different data labels, including: (1, Atelectasis; 2, Cardiomegaly; 3, Effusion; 4, Infiltration; 5, Mass; 6, Nodule; 7, Pneumonia; 8,
Pneumothorax; 9, Consolidation; 10, Edema; 11, Emphysema; 12, Fibrosis; 13,
Pleural_Thickening; 14 Hernia)  

## Introduction

### Background

Although chest X-ray exam is one of the most frequent and cost-effective medical imaging examinations,  the clinical diagnosis of chest X-ray is often significantly challenging. To achieve clinical accuracy on computer-aided detection and
diagnosis (CAD) in real world medical sites on chest X-rays is very
difficult [1] where the performance deep neural networks for thorax disease recognition is
severely limited by the availability of only 4143 frontal view images [2] (Openi is the previous
largest publicly available chest X-ray dataset to date).
